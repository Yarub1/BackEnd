Clinic-Management Backend API Server
Description
This project is a Node.js-based backend API server built using Express.js. It is designed for managing various healthcare-related operations such as managing patients, appointments, invoices, and more. The server is highly secured using multiple middlewares for security, including rate limiting, CSRF protection, and helmet for HTTP headers security. Additional features include file uploads, IP tracking, and user authentication via JWT tokens.

Features
Authentication: Uses JWT-based authentication for securing routes and validating user sessions. Route protection is implemented using the verifyToken middleware.

CSRF Protection: Integrated Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection using csurf middleware, ensuring secure form submissions.

Rate Limiting: Implements rate limiting on login routes using express-rate-limit to protect against brute-force attacks.

File Uploads: Supports uploading files using express-fileupload, with a temporary directory for processing and a permanent directory for storing files.

Security Enhancements:

Helmet: Secures HTTP headers to protect against known web vulnerabilities.
XSS Protection: Uses xss-clean middleware to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Cookie Security: Ensures that cookies are securely handled, marked as HttpOnly and Secure in production environments.
Logging: Logs HTTP requests using morgan in the "combined" format for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Database Management: Utilizes Sequelize ORM for database interactions, allowing for easy data management and syncing with databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

IP Tracking: Tracks the client’s IP address using the request-ip middleware, which is useful for logging and security audits.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
Sequelize: ORM for database management (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
CORS: Middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing.
CSRF Protection: Protection from CSRF attacks using csurf.
XSS Clean: Middleware to sanitize user inputs and prevent XSS.
Helmet: Middleware for securing HTTP headers.
Morgan: HTTP request logging.
Express File Upload: Middleware to handle file uploads.
Rate Limiting: Limits repeated requests using express-rate-limit.
JWT Authentication: Secures routes using JWT-based authentication.
IP Tracking: Tracks client IPs using request-ip.

API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /auth/login: Login and receive a JWT token.
POST /auth/signup: Register a new user.
Patients
GET /api/patients: Retrieve a list of all patients.
POST /api/patients: Add a new patient to the system.
Family Members
GET /api/family: Retrieve a list of all family members.
POST /api/family: Add a family member associated with a patient.
Appointments
GET /api/appointments: Retrieve all scheduled appointments.
POST /api/appointments: Schedule a new appointment.
Invoices
GET /api/invoices: Retrieve all invoices.
POST /api/invoices: Create a new invoice.
File Management
POST /api/files: Upload a file to the server.
Middleware
verifyToken: Protects API routes by validating JWT tokens for authenticated users.
helmet: Provides security by setting various HTTP headers to prevent attacks like XSS and clickjacking.
rateLimit: Implements rate limiting to limit the number of requests made to sensitive routes (e.g., login) within a defined time period.
Security
CSRF Protection: Protects against CSRF attacks using csurf middleware, ensuring that form submissions are valid and come from trusted sources.
XSS Cleaning: Cleans and sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks.
Secure Cookies: Ensures cookies are marked as Secure and HttpOnly to prevent access from client-side scripts, especially in production environments.
Logging
All incoming HTTP requests are logged using morgan in a "combined" format, providing detailed logging information including the client's IP, user-agent, and HTTP response status.

Error Handling
The server includes custom error-handling middleware to log and handle CSRF token errors, invalid login attempts, and other application errors. Invalid login attempts are logged with the client’s IP address and user-agent.

Notes
File Upload Management: The express-fileupload middleware handles file uploads. Uploaded files are stored in the /uploads directory, and temporary files are managed in the /temp directory.
Login Attempts: Limits login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks and logs failed attempts to the database.
